      "message": "Yes, GalleryActivity is still present, but if we set `enabled\u003d\"false\"` for it, it won\u0027t be. I think the parent change could be a good place to make that change.\n\nIt turns out that the blank image issue I described would happen with Gallery2 when you would tap on a screenshot (to view, not edit), then leave that screen and come back. I can\u0027t reproduce it with the edit feature.\n\nSo, I\u0027d prefer not to exclude these from recents, since it leads to unnecessary anxiety. For example, what if you\u0027re not done editing a photo but want to check an email that just came in? Excluding from recents means you can\u0027t go back, but going back works just fine and shouldn\u0027t cause problems.",
